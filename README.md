# pheno

This repository is for the documentation of Wcb pheno study. Firstly, Delphes samples are produced, then tuplized. Combine templates are then used to get the results.

# Delphes production

For the sample and ntuple production, see `production` folder. A detailed instruction is documented in `pheno/production/ihep.md`

# Analysis and results

The main Wcb result plots can be run using the scripts in `pheno/notebooks_wcb` folder, e.g., using `pheno/notebooks_wcb/fit_templ.ipynb` to plot the distribution and final results.

The "byproduct" Hbc results plots can be run using the scripts in `pheno/notebooks_hbc` folder, e.g., using `pheno/notebooks_wcb/hcb_tbhana.ipynb` to plot the distribution and final results.
